**ABOUT.ME**

Born in North Germany and raised in Stuttgart, I studied Media-, Sport- and Event-Management on the beautiful island of Mallorca.

Working in Marketing & PR at the Rally Dakar Team X-raid reinforced my orientation to the off-road sport. I'm currently working as junior marketing manager for the maas group in Essen. A manufacturer for off-road suspensions and similar equipment.

During off-time I can be found travelling the world, enjoying the unique magic of cinematography, or searching for the next adrenaline kick in extreme sports.
